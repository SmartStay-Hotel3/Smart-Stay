# **Smart Stay**

**Project Idea:**

Smart Stay is an innovative hotel concept that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
and modern technology to provide guests with a smart and seamless stay 
experience. The core idea is to utilize intelligent systems to manage every aspect of 
the hotel—from booking and room management to daily services assuring a 
smooth, personalized, and efficient experience for all guests.
Moreover, Smart Stay emphasizes sustainability and environmental preservation.
By implementing energy-saving technologies, efficient resource management, and 
waste reduction strategies, the project aims to offer a cutting-edge hospitality 
experience while minimizing its environmental impact, setting a benchmark for 
eco-friendly hotels of the future.
